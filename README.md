# Interview Work
code samples for interview questions

Refrencing code I have found on the internet as well as some customized code I wrote myself. Links to some of the code I used for learning can be found here https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Python.

Some of the other examples that helped with the java were found from this repo https://github.com/Turingfly/cracking-the-coding-interview/blob/master/src/chapter01ArraysAndStrings/PalindromePermutation.java

This repo is used as study material for myself and whoever else would like to use it.
